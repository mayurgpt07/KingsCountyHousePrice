#### Kings County Housing Price
File Name - KC_House_Data.py <br />
The problem is based on predicting house prices in the King's County region. In the problem, I have tried using multiple regression techniques like Least Square Linear Regression Technique (an adjusted R^2 value of 80.23%), Polynomial Regression (10-fold cross validation adjusted R^2 value of 85%) and Ridge Regression (10-fold cross validation value of 84.5%). The impressive thing is that even though the Polynomial regression has a better cross validation score than Ridge Regression, but due to the tunning parameter(lambda or alpha in scikit model) and the shrinkage penality we are able to give a better prediction.
